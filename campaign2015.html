<h4>Our 2015 Fundraising Campaign</h4><p>

<P> The OpenBSD Foundation needs your help to achieve our
fundraising goal of $200,000 for 2015. 
<P>
Reaching this goal will ensure the
continued health of the projects we support, will enable us to
help them do more, and will avoid the distraction of financial
emergencies that could spell the end of the projects.

<P>
2014 was a very good year for the foundation financially, due to a
number of unique events. A very public financial crisis at the start
of the year generated extensive community support, and the releases of
<A HREF="http://www.libressl.org">LibreSSL</A> generated significant interest and support.
<P>
It is important for us not to rely on one time events for our success.
<P>
Our goal for 2015 is to increase the amount of support we offer
for development, without compromising our regular support for the projects. 
We would like to:
<UL>
<LI> Plan and support more developer events (hackathons), and allow for more developers to attend these events.
<LI> Continue to improve the project infrastructure.
<LI> Fund more dedicated developer time for targeted development of specific projects. 
</UL>
<br>
<P> To achieve our goal we need both Individual and Corporate sponsorship of the foundation. To put our goal in context:
<UL>
<LI>If $10 were given for every installation of OpenBSD in the last year from the master site (ignoring the mirrors) we would be at our goal.
<LI>If $2 were given for every download of the OpenSSH source code in the last year from the master site (ignoring the mirrors) we would be at our goal.
<LI>If a penny was donated for every pf or OpenSSH installed with a mainstream operating system or phone in the last year we would be at our goal. 
</UL>
<P>
As an individual or corporation, the best kind of donation we can receive is a recurring donation. This allows longer term planning on our part, instead of hoping for one time cash infusions. The easiest way for an individual to support us in this way is a recurring Paypal donation, which is our preference. 
<P> Donations to the foundation can be made on our <A HREF=donations.html>Donations Page</A>. We can be contacted regarding corporate sponsorship at <A HREF="mailto:fundraising@openbsdfoundation.org">fundraising@openbsdfoundation.org</A>
